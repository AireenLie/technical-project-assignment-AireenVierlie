<h2>What is a Poem actually?</h2>
<p>A poem is a piece of 
 writing in which the expression of feelings and ideas is given
 intensity by particular attention to diction (sometimes involving rhyme), 
 rhythm, and imagery.
</p>

<h2>What is the meaning of life?</h2>
<p>It might not be what we always think about. But in my
    oppinion, the meaning of life is your own life purpose. Make your own
    life meaningful.
</p>
<h2>Is death final or does it lead to something else after all?</h2>
<p>A question I can't answer.</p>

<h2>Why does reality exist?</h2>
<p> Our understandings about reality is that it's our senses.
    Senses have its own limit,its own borders and so nothing from outside 
    these borders ever reaches us. So, what exist beyond our limits?
</p>

<h2>Why is the sky blue?</h2>
<p>The sky appears blue is because of oxygen molecules in Earth's atmosphere scattering light from the sun. </p>

<h2>Where does the conciousness reside?</h2>
<p> Some says in the body,some says in the mind. We still lack understandings
    about the human brain to know the exact answer.
