<h2>Quotes of Motivations</h2>

<p>"I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. 
    I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. 
    And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. 
    Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."</p>
    <p>― Frank Herbert, Dune</p>
<p>"Believe in yourself. You are braver than you think, more talented than you know, and capable of more than you imagine."
</p>
<p> ― Roy T. Bennett, The Light in the Heart</p>

<p>"Be grateful for what you already have while you pursue your goals.
    If you aren't grateful for what you already have, what makes you think you would be happy with more."</p>
<p>― Roy T. Bennett, The Light in the Heart </p>

<p>"Letting go means to come to the realization that some people are a part of your history, but not a part of your destiny."</p>
<p>― Steve Maraboli</p>

<p>"Never lose hope. Storms make people stronger and never last forever."</p>
<p> ― Roy T. Bennett, The Light in the Heart</p>

<p>"Imperfection is beauty, madness is genius and it's better to be absolutely ridiculous than absolutely boring."</p>
<p>― Marilyn Monroe</p>
